# ExpenseTracker
Brief repository in which is possible to understand the main differences between UIKit and SwiftUI.

This repository serves as an educational resource for novice iOS developers across the globe, highlighting the capabilities of Apple's two existing frameworks, namely, UIKit and SwiftUI. While these frameworks share similarities, they differ in significant ways. Through this example, learners can appreciate the strengths and simplicity of SwiftUI. It is important to note that the intention is not to ridicule UIKit, as it remains a valuable tool to comprehend and has practical applications.

The application pertains to an Expense Tracker, developed by @abdorizak, which I modified to enable its visibility upon startup. The modifications involved changes to the login and password systems. Notably, the SwiftUI component of the application was developed solely by myself. Additionally, I decided to redesign some of the app elements, to make it more native-ish.
